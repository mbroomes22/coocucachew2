# Coocucachew

Coocucachew is an e-commerce website that sells Cookies, Cupcakes, Cake-pops and Chocolates.
This page was based off the work that was started as 4-person a group project. The final project presented here is a product of the work done by myself, Michelle Broomes.

You can visit the site on https://coocucachew2.herokuapp.com/

## Tech stack

On the back end, Express was used to handle server calls, and PostgreSQL to store our Customers information, current cart and order history. On the front end, we used React/Redux to keep UI and state in sync, and local storage for Guest's cart. We also used Travis for continuous integration and Chai/Mocha for tests.
